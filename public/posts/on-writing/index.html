        <p>I always come back to writing—not the writing you do at school or in formal emails, but the writing you do on your terms.</p>
<p>At the age of 13, I was cultivating the idea of being an author. I vividly remember a green notebook that I used to write my first stories. I would write a chapter and then hand-copy pictures of knights in shiny armour from the history books. The notebook is long lost among boxes in my parents&rsquo; basement, but the memory lives on.</p>
<p>In secondary school, I moderated a blog on video games, writing game reviews, news articles, and opinion pieces. It was my hobby, along with the YouTube channel and online radio I co-authored. It was my first exposure to the complexities of technical writing: the research, the iterative nature of the process, and the refinement. I spent a couple of years doing it, but my interest eventually waned—too much was happening in my life.</p>
<p>I had short-lived attempts at micro-blogging early at uni. I like consuming short-format content in Tweets, but I always get back to long-term format: essays by the likes of Paul Graham, video essays (especially on video games), and specialised books, which would spend hundreds of pages discussing a single topic. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I still like micro-blogging - it is the fastest way to get from idea to post. However, it is hard to be intentional when limited to 240 characters. The price you pay for posting crap is minimal. You start to cater for short dopamine bursts and cheeky replies. Nothing wrong with that, but if you do it for long enough, it is easy to forget why you started in the first place. For me, it is the intention to be useful, the type of writing intended to <a href="https://paulgraham.com/useful.html">tell people something they do not already know and tell them as unequivocally as possible</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sadly, all my attempts at writing were abandoned. On a positive note, I always start again, and every time I do, I ask the same question—why did I stop in the first place, and how do I make sure it will not happen again? I always end up in an echo chamber of statements that sound valid but do not contribute to a solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What to write about? There is everything and absolutely nothing I wish I could share.</p>
<p>No one will ever read it, so why bother?</p>
<p>Am I an Impostor? Anyone reading my writing will know better! They will find me ridiculous, my ideas childish, their time wasted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Overcoming fear is hard, and finding a true meaning behind your thoughts and actions is even harder. Being honest with yourself is the first step to overcoming this fear. Asking myself questions such as &ldquo;Why do I come back to writing?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What is in there for me?&rdquo; helps a lot.</p>
<h1 id="writing-for-yourself">Writing for yourself<a href="#writing-for-yourself" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>It took me a very long time to internalise it, but I do write for myself. In the same way people write in personal journals, I write to converse with my past, present, and future selves.</p>
<p>Writing provides a means of learning more about things I encounter daily. Writing a technical article highlights the gaps in my knowledge. Writing about past events makes me relieve them again and capture lessons learnt. Writing about my feelings surfaces thoughts I suppress in my day-to-day life.
Like a sculptor, one can carve the meaning out of the comb of one&rsquo;s thoughts. It&rsquo;s an iterative process of questioning and eliminating noise. You refine until you get to the core. When you get there, you feel wiser; you understand yourself better.</p>
<p>Writing teaches discipline—in the way you organise and present thoughts—and is a form of self-regulation. It is easy to go on a tangent, avoid being intentional, and waste time. Writing intentionally teaches you to respect yourself.</p>
<p>Writing is a backlog of your thoughts. It reflects the person you are now, and it is extremely valuable. In the future, you will find this data precious. Returning to old entries highlights how much you&rsquo;ve learnt and how you changed as a person. It is the most effective way to log your progress and align yourself with the person you want to be.</p>
<h1 id="writing-for-others">Writing for others<a href="#writing-for-others" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>Writing about something you care about has a very high chance of alignment with what others care about. Something I believe is purely personal might end up very valuable for others. Something you believe to be a banality, a simple thought in your day-to-day life that is &ldquo;surely obvious to everyone else&rdquo;, is a novel thought for many. It is worth sharing this knowledge with others.</p>
<p>In the words of Paul Graham</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way to get novelty is to write about topics you&rsquo;ve thought about a lot. Then you can use yourself as a proxy for the reader in this department too. Anything you notice that surprises you, who&rsquo;ve thought about the topic a lot, will probably also surprise a significant number of readers. And here, as with correctness and importance, you can use the Morris technique to ensure that you will. If you don&rsquo;t learn anything from writing an essay, don&rsquo;t publish it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sharing with others is liberating. One can discover a lot by putting his ideas on paper and exposing them to others. But most importantly, it lets you declutter your thoughts and present them in a way you see right, and it is a great feeling.</p>
<p>Structuring your thoughts and building a coherent story is surprisingly hard. Tailoring it to your target audience is even harder. And even then, you should always ask yourself why someone would read what you wrote. Refinement benefits both parties. In a world filled with noise, people search for authors who have something useful to say.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>I intend to write more. It is hard, but I hope I stick to it. I recently picked up <a href="https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/">Show Your Work</a> by Austin Kleon in hopes it will help me overcome my fears of sharing what I believe is &ldquo;half-baked and pointless&rdquo; ideas with the world.</p>
<h1 id="thougts-section">Thougts section<a href="#thougts-section" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h1>
<p>A section of quotes and notes I have used for this article.</p>
<p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/useful.html">https://paulgraham.com/useful.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>if you write a bad sentence, you don&rsquo;t publish it. You delete it and try again. Often you abandon whole branches of four or five paragraphs. Sometimes a whole essay.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the sciences, this is called publication bias, and is considered bad. When some hypothesis you&rsquo;re exploring gets inconclusive results, you&rsquo;re supposed to tell people about that too. But with essay writing, publication bias is the way to go.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made without becoming false.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put them all together. Useful writing tells people something true and important that they didn&rsquo;t already know, and tells them as unequivocally as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s one other quality I aim for in essays: to say things as simply as possible. But I don&rsquo;t think this is a component of usefulness. It&rsquo;s more a matter of consideration for the reader. And it&rsquo;s a practical aid in getting things right; a mistake is more obvious when expressed in simple language. But I&rsquo;ll admit that the main reason I write simply is not for the reader&rsquo;s sake or because it helps get things right, but because it bothers me to use more or fancier words than I need to. It seems inelegant, like a program that&rsquo;s too long.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/simply.html">https://paulgraham.com/simply.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course, fancy writing doesn&rsquo;t just conceal ideas. It can also conceal the lack of them. That&rsquo;s why some people write that way, to conceal the fact that they have nothing to say. Whereas writing simply keeps you honest. If you say nothing simply, it will be obvious to everyone, including you.</p>
