# Tiny projects
I first encountered the idea of Tiny Projects from the [TinyWebsite](https://tinyprojects.dev/posts/six_months_of_tiny_projects). 
Tiny projects are about starting a project and releasing it to the public in a short period of time. Unfortunately, I have always struggled to see my creations make it to production; it's always "one more feature" or "one more bug to fix". Following the "tiny" methodology is an attempt to resolve it. As part of my 2023 resolution, I would like to create and release several projects, each taking up to several months, and share my findings in this blog.
