I first encountered the idea of Tiny Projects in the [TinyWebsite](https://tinyprojects.dev/posts/six_months_of_tiny_projects). The concept that sounded strange at first occupied my mind for days -  what if I could set myself to deliver the project every couple of months without worrying about it being perfect? Unfortunately, I have always struggled to see my creations make it to production; it's always "one more feature" or "one more bug to fix". Following the "tiny" methodology is an attempt to overcome those mental blocks, see my projects graduate the incubator stage, and learn something new.

As part of my 2023 resolution, I would like to create and release several projects, each taking up to several months, and share my learnings with others. The personal blog you are reading is the first "tiny" project. Hopefully, there are many more to come!
